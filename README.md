# 🌴 The Wild Oasis

A feature-rich hotel management dashboard built with **React.js**, designed to handle bookings, cabins, guests, and more.  
This project helped me strengthen my skills in **React**, **React Router**, **state management**, **APIs**, and **UI design**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🏨 **Cabin Management** – Add, edit, and delete cabins with real-time updates.
- 📅 **Bookings Dashboard** – View, filter, and manage guest bookings.
- 👤 **Guest Management** – Track guest details and booking history.
- 📊 **Dashboard Analytics** – View total revenue, occupancy rate, and more.
- 🌙 **Dark/Light Mode** – Custom theme toggling for better UX.
- 🔒 **Authentication** – Secure login with protected routes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router DOM, styled-components, Context API
- **Design**: Custom CSS with a modern, responsive layout
- **State Management**: useState, useEffect, useReducer, custom hooks
- **Data**: Fetched from Supabase (or fake API for demo purposes)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth or custom auth (based on version)
